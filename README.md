As Boston University college of engineering students we have first hand experience of being in Boston, 
but we also have first hand experience of never exploring the city because we're always too busy. We created this app in order to help other
non-Bostonians find their way around some of the hot spots in Boston. We offer 3 different
types of tours ranging from history to arts and even sports to appeal to a large range of 
tourists. We hope you enjoy using our app!
