#About
Have you ever wandered around a new city lost and unsure where you should go? Well, if you’re in Boston, Massachusetts, Pahk the Cah is the right app for you!  Pahk the Cah allows you to explore Boston without having to take out your tourist guide book and lug it around the city.  The app allows for 3 different categories that include Historical, Sports, and Arts and Museums.  Once you select a category, 9 different hot spot locations around Boston come up.  Whatever picture speaks to you, you press on and the picture enlarges with a description underneath.  You’re so enthralled by this place, you have to go, but how?  Well, lucky for you, Pahk the Cah uses Google Maps to give you walking instructions to your desired location.  Once you get there, you are free to roam and explore the area at your leisure!

#Google Maps
We used the Google Maps API as the main feature in our app.
  - By pressing the "Take Me There" button, Google Maps opens and gives directions.
