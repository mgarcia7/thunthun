    <string name="backgroundtext">As Boston University college of engineering students we have first
        hand experience of being in Boston, but we also have first hand experience of never
        exploring the city because we're always too busy. We created this app in order to help other
        non-Bostonians find their way around some of the hot spots in Boston. We offer 3 different
        types of tours ranging from history to arts and even sports to appeal to a large range of
        tourists. We hope you enjoy using our app! </string>
